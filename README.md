# HIV fitness landscape
Infer the fitness landscape of HIV-1 from longitudinal, deep sequencing intrapatient data.

## Results
- The mutation rates are in `data/mutation_rate.tsv` in logarithms of 10.
- The site-specific fitness costs in HXB2 coordinates are located in `data/nuc_*_selection_coefficients_any.tsv`, where `*` indicates any of several genomic regions: gag, pol, env, nef, vif, vpu, and vpr.

## Folders
- `src`: scripts
- `data`: additional data (HIVEVO_access data must be present too)
